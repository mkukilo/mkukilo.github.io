                    <p>Tokyo — Fears of a second surge of coronavirus infections are forcing early-hit countries to
                        rethink plans for re-opening as new cases come to light. China is now testing millions of
                        people to catch new infections. South Korea has dispatched several thousand police officers
                        in a renewed push for contact tracing. </p>

                        <p>One in 400 people in England is infected with coronavirus, a survey of 11,000 people in
                            households suggests.
                            They were asked to carry out swab tests over the two weeks up to 10 May.
                            This indicates about 148,000 people in England could be currently infected - 0.27% of the
